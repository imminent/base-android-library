base-android-library
====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imminent/base-android-library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/imminent/base-android-library)

Core code to be reused in other Android apps. [at GitHub](https://github.com/imminent/base-android-library)

## Building

./gradlew

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.0.3+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/home/roberto/tools/android-sdk

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `mvn clean cobertura:cobertura -P default -P cobertura; mvn sonar:sonar -P cobertura` to run the tests and create the code analysis for viewing in Sonar
* Run `mvn clean install` to run the instrumented tests on the connected devices
